Five times more deadly than the flu, COVID-19 causes significant morbidity and mortality. Like other pneumonias, pulmonary infection with COVID-19 results in inflammation and fluid in the lungs. COVID-19 looks very similar to other viral and bacterial pneumonias on chest radiographs, which makes it difficult to diagnose. 
As the leading healthcare organization in their field, the Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine (SIIM)'s mission is to advance medical imaging informatics through education, research, and innovation. 


This project identifies and localizes COVID-19 abnormalities on chest radiographs. In particular, categorizing the radiographs as negative for pneumonia or typical, indeterminate, or atypical for COVID-19. This project is divided into 4 parts where every part implements training and tests of the dataset with diffrent machine learning models. The machine learning approaches implemented in each parts are:

1. Classification using Na√Øve Bayes Classifier 
2. Clustering using  EM, GMM, hierarchical clustering.
3. Supervised Learning using random forests and K-Mean algorithms with 10 fold cross validation
4. Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks with 10 fold cross validation 
5. Implementation of PSO with advantages and disadvantages over any other models.
